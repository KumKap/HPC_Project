# HPC_Project
HPC Project (Sem 8, MU) based on optimizing KMEANS (2D only) using MPI in Python. 
Use pip install -r requirements.txt to setup the environment.
You will also require xampp server if you want to run the web app(optional).
Folder HPC consist of Web App interface for the project. Directly place it in htdocs of XAMPP Folder.
Folder HPC_Project (inside HPC) has two variation of Kmeans. 
Kmeans2 works relatively better as it optimizes the calculation of new centroids.
Folder Dataset contaans validation sets for the program. File name indicates the actual number of proper cluster sets in the file.
